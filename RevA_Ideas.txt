new pedal switcher ideas:
	Board mount as much as possible: footswitches, jacks
	Footswitches: TBD 
	dual jacks (page 18-19) http://www.amphenolaudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/55010575000220_acjm-mhde.pdf
	Isolation (optoisolators, digital isolators). Two jacks?
	Lots of provisions for trying things (jumpers, etc, options for two jacks)
	circuit that ramps volume down vs mute circuit
	pop remover IC?
	MIDI in and out
	tuner
